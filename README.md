How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Based on what the user needs, user stories are created to give the devlopment team insight on broken down tasks to complete a main goal for 
the customer. User stories provide information on the priority of the task, the goal of the task, and the acceptance criteria. 


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
It is important to approach programs with an open mind and to be prepared for changes during the development of the project. 
In agile, a project is broken down into user stories to allow for the timeline for each task to be estimated, create high quality work, 
and divide the work between the development team. I intend to incorporate open communication and flexibility into my future development
work. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In software development, a good team member has a strong understanding of their skills to ensure they can complete the tasks they 
are assigned, flexible, especially when adjustments to the project need to be made, strong communication skills, and is able to communicate when 
they have an issue or need to provide constructive criticism to other team members.
